			<h2>If that is what you're looking for then read on!</h2>
			<p>Now that you're here, I'll assume you're sick of all the clutter on the web. Sites with flashy rollovers and fancy dancing images with shooting stars and cutesy kittensâ€¦ there's a time and a place for that.  What you really want is a clean, crisp design with bold colors, easy readability, and a layout that puts your information at the forefront, you know, what people are coming to your site to find.</p>
			<p>If you dig minimalism and simplicity, or goal-oriented design, then I'm your man. By following the latest web standards and best practices, I can help you create a site your target audience will love.</p>

			<h2>Want to hire me?</h2>
			<p>Get in touch to discuss any web related projects.  I work well with Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and more.  I also offer consulting services if you need help with direction for your new or existing website. Whether a new site, an overhaul, or anything in between, an email is the first step to 'done'.

			<h2 class="accentGold">Asset Collection</h2>
			<p>The first phase is a review of all your current information, photos, case studies, testimonials... anything pertinent to your site goal is gathered and reviewed. This is the time to test all your information for pertinence and 'up-to-date-ness.'</p>
		</div>
		<div class="threecol">
			<h2 class="accentGold">Information Architecture</h2>
			<p>Now that we have all that information, it's time to review how it will best be organized for consumption by your target audience.  Someone may come to your site looking for a calendar, a menu, directions to somewhere... Working to get them the information most efficiently makes your website great in their perspective.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="threecol">
			<h2 class="accentGold">Design Look and Feel</h2>
			<p>No kittens, no dancing rainbow images, no spinning email graphics.  We can work towards a clean design that effectively transmits your brand or message. Color is good, readability and accessibility is better.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="threecol last">
			<h2 class="accentGold">Build and Host</h2>
			<p>The last step is to bring the design to life and place your words on a real website! The details of where and how it's hosted are worked out here. The project will be reassesed to ensure it meets the project goals and requirements, then you're free to go!*</p>

			<h2>A little about me</h2>
			<p>My name is Paul Northup and I am a Web Developer at Bentley University.  I love the clean, simple, minimalist aspects of web design and enjoy pursuing freelance projects that venture outside the realm of Academia.  I've been working with websites, code, and graphics for over 10 years and keeping up with the technology has become a passion of mine.</p>
			<p>Aside from the geek credentials, I love snowboarding, skateboarding, and travel (especially when they're put together). I love to have fun and have a good sense of humor so feel free to bring yours too! It makes working that much more enjoyable!
